README

1. Figure out why the images are so spaced out
2. Find Rufus' title and put in the right place.
3. Make smaller and correctly align the cheesy title. HALF
4. Make the middle section with three parts smaller and reasonable.
5. Add icons to middle section.
6. Correctly size the stylist images.
7. Find the hours that go on the side of the screen and get that shit up and running.
8. Add a snazzy picture for the color day? Maybe used an otherwise neglected color picture, use something actually with hair lol.
9. Properly resize main big picture. THINK I DID THIS

READ ME PART TWO:
Move button lower so that it and the h1 in the hero section don't overlap.
Reformat .ourlookbook img, add border and maybe some additional shadow? But focus on a border first and foremost.
Figure out how to line up all the .proimages on the same row and make them take up like 33%.
Figure out potentially how to format things more creatively so this isn't too much like The Poisoned Apple.

LOOK FOR ICONS AFTER YOU HAVE EVERYTHING FIGURED OUT FORMATTING WISE **AND** AFTER YOU HAVE THE PALETTE SOLIDIFIED

AT END: Build bottom bar like Le Petit Salon. Consider adding a video section like them too.
